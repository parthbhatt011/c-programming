# c-programming
This repository contains my complete C programming practice journey, organized from basic syntax to advanced concepts. It includes topic-wise code examples, data structures implemented in C, tricky interview questions, hands-on practice problems, and clean, well-documented programs. The goal is to build a strong foundation in C .
